  void set_mix() / set_mix_in()

- resonance normalization?
- freq/reso normalization?
- multiple modes
  ~ NOTCH
  ~ possibly: HP3 LP3 LP6|8 HP6|8 BP6|8
  ~ mode API should have enum
  ~ 2nd order filters should only have one non-linearity
- compare to / check in laddervcf.hh
- normalize non-linearity output to [-1:1]
- allow reso > 1 for slightly unstable filter
- prescale should be reduced for increased reso
  ~ make reso more audible for drive == 0dB
- change drive range to 0..8 & x^3
- support fast resonance changes (resonance tables for HP4|LP4)
- test integration in SpectMorph
- possibly use tanh approximation
- possibly use SIMD instructions
