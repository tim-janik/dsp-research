- laddervcf may need stack limit (like SKFilter)
- compare to laddervcf.hh
- clamp freq range
- double check reso / drive normalization
  ~ prescale should be reduced for increased reso
  ~ make reso more audible for drive == 0dB
  ~ possibly change drive range to 0..8 & x^3
  ~ allow reso > 1 for slightly unstable filter
  ~ support reso > 1 for stages > 1
