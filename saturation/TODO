- once we have automation, it is better to perform saturation in 3 steps
  -> upsample whole input
  -> saturation / automation with smaller blocks
  -> downsample whole input
- may want to process dry signal without oversampling
- probably need DC blocker
- could have better tanh approximation
- may want to oversample higher than 8x
